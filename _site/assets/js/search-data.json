[IMG] Let us jump in to see what they are and how they work. Accounts An account is an overarching entity that owns all your projects and houses them together under one subdomain - https://comapanyname.zepel.io. An account is usually the name of your company where people are added either as a Member or an Admin. Projects A project is where members of in your organization come together to achieve a common goal. Projects can be features your company is working on, or represent teams such as Design or Data Science. [IMG] People collaborated in a project will be automatically added to the respective account as a Member if they aren’t already part of that account. Read more about Projects -&gt; Lists A list is a collection of actionable work that your team can execute. Each list, depending on how you’ve named your project, can be either a feature or a team. Lists contain actionable next steps that can be assigned and tracked. This is where work gets done. [IMG] Read more about Lists -&gt; User Stories, Tasks, Subtasks, Enhancements, and Bugs Your list can be broken down into smaller chunks of executable work. They can be assigned to more than one person, have due dates, estimates, and statuses. [IMG] The completion of all work items inside each list will determine your entire project’s progress. Read more about creating work items -&gt; Boards Boards in Zepel let you and your team track progress of your work items. A Board ideally represents a workflow each item flows through. Since most projects require members from other teams to get involved, you can have multiple Boards in your project to accomodate each team’s workflow.

IN THIS PAGE Create a Project Add Lists inside a Project Create Items Already created and organized your project? Collaborate and add a Board for every team involved in your project. Create a Project A project is where group of members come together to achieve a common goal. Projects in Zepel can represent teams such as Engineering and Data Science. [IMG] But if you prefer to have projects named after features your company is working on, Zepel will work just fine. Add Lists inside a Project Projects in Zepel can have multiple Lists. That way, if you have your project named after specific teams, each list of tasks can represent the feature your team is working on. [IMG] And if your project is named after a feature, each list can represent specific teams involved in your feature, so you can see what’s happening in every team in your project. [IMG] Create Items Items and its types - Stories, Enhancements, Bugs, Tasks, and Subtasks are at the core of Zepel. You can delegate, set deadlines, and track statuses of your work. Once you’ve created a List inside your project, start adding related work items into your list, so you can keep your team aligned on same page. When your List is empty, you can choose to create a Section or a Task. To change an item’s type, right click on the item and select which type you would like to change to. Hit [ Tab ] to turn any item into a Subtask. [IMG] Keyboard Shortcuts: Turn any item into a task by typing - at the beginning of an item. Toggle between item types using Ctrl + Shift + S (or Cmd + Shift + S if you use a Mac). Add a Section to group similar items together by typing * at the beginning of an item.

If you decide not to add your card details at the end of the trial period, but still want to continue using Zepel, remove members from your account, so there are 5 members or fewer in your account.

No. You will not be charged for the first 5 members. You will be charged only from the 6th member. For example, if your account has 8 members and you are on the monthly plan, you will be charged only for the 3 additional members. What payment methods do you accept? We accept all types of credit cards. We currently do not accept cheques or direct transfers. How can I cancel my subscription? If you decide you want to stop your paid subscription, you can remove members from your account and switch to our FREE plan.

    "title": "Project Management",
    "content": "Manage Projects with Zepel Every organization and team have their own ways of managing projects and shipping features. In this article, we’ll see you how you can manage your projects in Zepel, so you never drop the ball with the features you build. 1. Create a Project Creating a project is the first thing you’d be doing once you sign up for Zepel. Its where people with a common goal come together to help ship your feature. A project in Zepel is usually a team, like Web App or Android or iOS. But if you choose to name your project after a feature, like Dashboard, that works too! [IMG] While creating a project, you will be able to add one or more Boards into your project that you can use to move your work across Boards or statuses. Learn how to create a project -&gt; 2. Create Lists Once you’ve created a project, you can now create multiple Lists. A list is usually a feature that houses all actionable items - user stories, tasks, subtasks, bugs, and enhancements - within it. Each list can have: An owner who can oversee the feature A duration to ensure the feature is built within a said timeline, and A status to keep everyone updated on progress [IMG] Note: Teams that name a project after a feature, usually create a List for each team involved in shipping the feature. Learn more about organizing Lists -&gt; 3. Create Items Once you’ve created a List for a feature your team is working on, its time to start adding items. You can create: User Stories Tasks Subtasks Enhancements Bugs Sections Learn how you can quickly create a list of items -&gt; But of course, creating a list of items alone isn’t enough. You’ll want to delegate it, set a deadline, and track its progress. All items in Zepel, except Sections, can have item properties: Assignees Status Due Date Estimate [IMG] You can add item properties by typing / to trigger all commands. Alternatively, you can open up an item’s details pop-up to set or change any of the properties. Learn how you can delegate and track work items -&gt; 4. Add Boards When you’re working on a feature, you’ll need people from other teams - design, QA, and marketing - to contribute as well. But how do you accomodate each of their workflows into your project? Sure, you can add a generic status called “Design In Progress”. But does it mean the mockups are ready for your front end developer to pick it up? Or does it mean the design team is still iterating on getting it pixel perfect? With Boards in Zepel, you can add multiple Boards in your project to accomodate each of your team’s workflow, so everyone can collaborate and work together. [IMG] All trackable items across lists can move from one status to another like a traditional kanban board and move from one Board to another. That means, when your designer is ready with the mockups for your frontend developer to pick it up, the item can move from Design - Done to Dev - Todo. Learn how to set statuses and manage workflows -&gt; 5. Use My Tasks to work and update every one Sometimes you want to work distraction free. Without having to look at all the other items required to build your new feature. Use My Tasks in Zepel to see just the items assigned to you across all lists in all projects. [IMG] With the Sort, you can choose to view items assigned to you just the way you’d like. Group and sort them by due dates, sort by estimates, based on which List they’re in, and order them by ascending or descending. To make it even more easier, you can work on your items from the comfort of your desktop using Zepel’s Desktop Widget. That way, you can complete and update your team with Zepel right next to your code editor, and not even open your browser. [IMG] Learn more about Desktop Widget -&gt; 6. Track progress of each Feature with Lists Overview As your team starts working on the feature, you don’t just want to know who is working on which item and its status, you want to know progress of the feature itself. Lists Overview is the command center for your project. You can see progress of your entire feature, know who is responsible for overseeing the completion of the it, its current status, and its duration. [IMG] With the capability to view all your lists in Kanban to make it easier for you prioritize your feature and Table view to quickly see a timeline of what’s next, product managers and team leaders can quickly get a bird’s eye view of what’s happening in real-time. Learn more about Lists Overview -&gt; 7. Reports to help drive your project forward As your project progresses, you’ll want to keep an eye on the reports to quickly guage if your on track. Head over to the Dashboard tab on your project to see a quick overview of how your project has progressed in the last 14 days. If you’re running Sprints, you can view Burnup or Burndown chart for your specific sprint from the sprints menu.",
