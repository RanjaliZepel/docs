IN THIS PAGE Accounts Projects Features Items Boards Below is an image of how a project with multiple features, items, and boards fit inside your account to help you seemlessly organize and track. [IMG] Let us jump in to see what they are and how they work. Accounts An account is an overarching entity that owns all your projects and houses them together under one subdomain - https://comapanyname.zepel.io. An account is usually the name of your company where people are added either as a Member or an Admin. Projects A project is where members of in your organization come together to achieve a common goal. Projects can be features your company is working on, or represent teams such as Design or Data Science. People collaborated in a project will be automatically added to the respective account as a Member if they aren’t already part of that account. Read more about Projects -&gt; Features A Feature is a collection of actionable work that your team can plan, track, and execute. As your members across teams start to work on this feature, you can see how the entire Feature is progressing right from here. Read more about Features -&gt; Items Your Feature can be broken down into smaller chunks of executable work. They can be assigned to more than one person, have due dates, estimates, and statuses. An item can be: User Story Task Subtask Bug Enhancement Section The completion of all work items inside each Feature will determine your entire project’s progress. Read more about creating work items -&gt; Boards Boards in Zepel let you and your team track progress of your work items. A Board ideally represents a workflow each item flows through. Since most projects require members from other teams to get involved, you can have multiple Boards in your project to accomodate each team’s workflow. This allows members to track items across Features in a Board that fits their workflow. Read more about Boards -&gt;",

Collaboration, while building features, isn’t just about assigning tasks, sharing files, or having conversations. While they are a part of the collaboration process, most teams resort to face to face communication or meetings if their workflow gets disrupted. In this article, we’ll see you how you can bring in members from every team together and build your next feature. All without disrupting their workflow. 1. Create a Project Give your project a name. Most projects in Zepel are named after a team, like Engineering. But if you prefer naming your project after an open ended product like Web App or Mobile, that works well too! When creating a project, you’ll be asked to add Boards that teams can use to track and manage their work. 2. Create Features Once you’ve created a project, its time create Features. Features in Zepel is a collection of actionable items - user stories, tasks, subtasks, bugs, and enhancements - that can be tracked and executed. Learn more about organizing Features -&gt; 3. Add Items To start tracking your feature, add items - User Stories, Tasks, Subtasks, Bugs, and Enhancements.. Use Sections to organize your Feature. Add assignees and due dates to delegate work to team members. That way, everyone knows who is working on what and help you ship your feature faster. NOTE: Sometimes, you’ll find you need to work on items that don’t belong to a specific feature. Product wide tech debts or bugs. You can quickly add them into your project’s List. 4. Add Boards Boards in Zepel are the workflows through which items can move through. Items can move within a Board - from one status to another. Or from one Board to another. Once you’ve created a Items inside your Feature, its time to add a Board for every team involved in building your feature. With a Board tailor-made for every team, each member can work just the way they want without settling for a generic “In Progress” status. Your designer would move their work in Design Board. And once your desiger is ready with design, your front-end developer can pick it up from Design Board and start moving it across his Development Board. Learn how to set statuses and manage workflows -&gt; 5. Make progress with Sprint or Boards Zepel fits the way your team works. Whether you decide to use Sprints or Kanban methodology or a combination of both, Zepel will fit and adapt to your process. Want to run a Sprint? Simply create one, add Sprint items, and delegate work. If you prefer a simple Kanban process, simply push work items to a Board and assign it to a team member and watch them make progress with using Reports. And the best part? Your team members get to focus on just the things they care about without losing context of the big picture using our Desktop Widget. 6. Watch features progress While members from every team pick up items assigned to them move them across statuses and Boards, you can see how your feature take its shape and progress across teams. If you want to see what each team is working on, you can simply click on their respective Board and get a quick glance of what’s happening.

    "title": "How engineering managers use Zepel to plan and ship features",
    "content": "How engineering managers use Zepel Engineering managers take features, break it down to actionable chunks of work and manage the engineering team to ensure the feature is built with efficiency. Since engineering managers work with both the product manager and the entire engineering team, their focus often shifts between strategy and managing personnels. In this article, we’ll see how engineering managers use Zepel to manage workload within their team while working with product managers to define the strategic execution of the feature. 1. Create a Project for your team As an engineering manager, you’d want to house all the features your team will be working on under one single project. A project in Zepel is usually a team, like Engineering, Backend, or Frontend. But if you choose to name your project after a product or an initiative, such as Web App or Android or iOS, that works too. [IMG] While creating your project, add Boards your team will use to move items across statuses. If you find your project needs more Boards as your team makes progress on the feature, you can add them from within the project. Learn how to create a project -&gt; 2. Create a List for your feature and prioritize Once a project is created for your team, add a List for each feature your team will be working on. A list houses all actionable items - user stories, tasks, subtasks, bugs, and enhancements - for a specific feature. Normally, the product manager would create Lists and add all the required user stories. Once the product manager has added all the required user stories and descriptions to each feature, you can sit together to give a high level estimate of how long each feature could take and help the product manager prioritize features using the Kanban view. [IMG] 3. Bring in team members to estimate user stories Collaborate with team members and start breaking down user stories into actionable subtasks based on the acceptance criteria added in the description area. Breaking down user stories into subtasks will give your team clarity and help them estimate better. With the help your team members, give each user story an estimate after discussing with your team on the how they’ll execute them. Based on the estimates provided by you and your team, the product manager can now add priority to key user stories from the advanced filter page, and help you and your team focus on the things that are important. [IMG] 4. Delegate prioritized work to team members Once key user stories are prioritized the product manager will give the list an owner, duration, and a status. The owner for the list is usually the person who will oversee the specific feature and ensure its completion within the duration. Depending on how your organization is structured, that could be the engineering manager as well. When its time to begin working on the feature, you can start assigning the prioritized set of user stories and enhancements to your team members. Answer questions to team members on specific items using comments and give them all the information they need to build the feature. [IMG] 5. Track progress of the feature and manage workload As your team work on the features and make progress, get a quick progress update of how your feature has progressed from Lists Overview. [IMG] Use the advanced filters from within your team’s Board to drill in and see how much work each member is working on. That way, you know exactly how much work each member is working on along with their statuses. Now, you can see each team member’s bandwidth in one view and know who has capacity to work on more items and who is overloaded. This will help you quickly manage your team’s workload and route work efficiently. [IMG]",

    "content": "Difference between Feature Board and Project Board Project Boards Project Boards are visible on the sidebar within your project. You can have multiple Boards in your project. Each Board can be used by multiple Features. For example, if you have two Features named Search and Reports with Dev Board being used in both the Features, you will view all items from both the Features on the Dev Board if you open it from the project sidebar. [IMG] If your project board is used in multiple Features within your project, you will be able to view all items across Features. You can choose to filter your Board based on a specific Feature to view just those items. Project Boards can also be Favourited to quickly access them from the sidebar. Project Boards are useful when you want to see where work stands across Features. For example, you might want to see what all work is happening in different features in the Dev Board. The project board also comes in handy when you want to manage your team’s workload. Feature Board Within a Feature Board, you will view items only from that particular Feature. Furthermore, there are two types of Feature Boards: Default Feature Board: All items in the Feature will use this Board when status is not set. Other Boards: When an item is explictly moved to a Board that is not the Default Board. [IMG] Feature Boards can not be favourited. Feature Boards are useful when you want to just see what’s happening within a specific Feature. With just a quick glance you can see the different workflows being used to complete the feature. And by clicking on the Feature Board, you can see where each item stands.",

Once you’ve signed up and created a project for your team, you are only 3 steps away from tracking progress of your feature. In this article we will take you through the top 3 tips, so you can quickly bring in members from every team to start building and tracking features. IN THIS PAGE Create Feature to plan and track progress Create Items Add Boards for every workflow Create Feature to plan and track progress A Feature is a collection of users stories, tasks, subtasks, bugs, and enhancements. A project can have multiple features, so you can track everything that’s happening in your project. And if you have miscellaneous work that are not part of a Feature, you can add them to your project’s List. Create Items Items and its types - Stories, Enhancements, Bugs, Tasks, and Subtasks - are at the core of Zepel. You can delegate, set deadlines, and track statuses of your work. Once you’ve created a Feature inside your project, start adding items, so you can keep your team on same page. To change an item’s type, right click on the item and select which type you would like to change to. Hit [ Tab ] to turn any item into a Subtask. Keyboard Shortcuts: Turn any item into a task by typing - at the beginning of an item. Toggle between item types using Ctrl + Shift + S (or Cmd + Shift + S if you use a Mac). Add a Section to group similar items together by typing * at the beginning of an item. Add Boards for every workflow Building features is a cross team effort. And since each team has their own way of working, you can add a Board tailor-made just for them. That way, when you bring in a designer to help design your new feature, or a QA team to test your completed feature, they can all work from within the Project with a workflow that suits their need. Learn more about Boards in Zepel Go ahead, start your first project in Zepel. It’ll only take a minute to see how effortless it is to work on features with cross team collaboration and track progress across teams.",

Jira Zepel Jira Projects Projects: Jira projects get imported into Zepel as projects. Epics Features: All Jira Issues of type “Epic” get imported into Zepel as separate Feature. All issues linked to epic will be imported as items inside the Feature. Additional properties (like status, estimate etc) of an Epic are lost when the epic is moved from Jira to Zepel. Workflows Boards: Workflows from Jira get imported into Zepel as boards. Each workflow in the Jira project becomes a separate board. Each status of the workflow gets a unique column. Note that workflows in Zepel have only one start state and one end state. During the import, the first start state in the JIRA workflow becomes the start state in Zepel. The End State with the most number of items in the Jira workflow gets chosen as the end state in Zepel. Boards - Due Dates Due Date: Due dates are maintained for every issue. Estimates Estimate: Estimates are migrated from Jira to Zepel (in points). Issue Status Status: Issue status are maintained when issues are migrated from Jira to Zepel.

They can rely on real-time updates of how the features are progressing with Progress. With Boards and Filters, they can now quickly see the team’s capactiy and manage their workload. In this article, we’ll see how you can quickly get an understanding of where each of your team members’ work stand and how you can use this to route work efficiently. 1. Give each team a workflow tailor-made just for them Once you’ve created a Feature within your project and added user stories and tasks within them, you should add Boards for each discipline involved in helping you ship your feature. For example, you’d need a Designer to help design the feature, a development team to build the feature, and QA team to test it. Add a Board for each of these disciplines. Building features requires teams to come together and collaborate. At first, its usually just the product manager, engineering manager, developers, and the designer. And as your feature nears completion, you’ll want to bring in your QA team to ensure the feature is bug free and even your marketing team to help get the word out. So, how do you fit all their workflow into a single project project management tool? Create separate projects? Surely, not! Because then how would you collaborate and build features together? In Zepel, you can give each discipline a Board within your project. That way, every time your team mates work on the feature, they can work just the way they want and be more productive. Learn how to add Boards -&gt; 2. Switch to your team’s board and drill in Head over to your team’s Board to see where each item stands. With just a click, the Board provides you a single view of all items that requires your team’s attention. Slice and dice your team’s Board using advanced filters to see who is working on which feature and its current status.

    "title": "Prioritize Features in Zepel",
    "content": "Plan and prioritize the right features Product managers use Zepel to plan their next set of features and to prioritize them. Prioritizing features is hard mostly because the needs of your business is ever changing. What was a top priority few weeks ago could easily be something you can’t afford to spend time on right now. Which is why it’s key to be able to see what’s happening within your team and use that context when planning and prioritizing your next bunch of features. In this article, we’ll show how you can see what your team’s working on, their progress, and how you can use that context to plan your next set of features and prioritize them. 1. Put User Stories together and plan your feature Don’t worry about prioritizing the feature at first. Create a Feature within your project and put together all user stories and tasks you’d ideally want to accomplish. Add acceptance criteria for your user stories within the Description to help everyone understand what’s expected of them. 2. Understand your team’s current progress Your team is most likely working on a couple of other features, completed few user stories, and made some progress. Since all features your team is working on is inside your project, this makes it effortless for you as the product manager to see what’s happening in the feature and who is working on which user story or enhancement. But knowing where each user story stands isn’t going to be enough if you want to get a bird’s eye view of what’s happening. You need to quickly distil all the progress your developer team, designer, and QA team made into useful information to make sense out of them. With Progress, you can get a quick snapshot of how much progress your team has made and how far away they are from completing the feature. 3. See features in Kanban to Prioritize The entire thought process of prioritizing features is a whole different beast altogether. We’ve put together a process and wrote in detail about how you should think about prioritizing your feature over here. With the right thought process and the context of your team’s current feature progress, you can now view and rearrange your features in a Kanban and start prioritizing them. From the Progress tab, switch to Kanban view to see all your features neatly stacked based on their current status. Rearrange features within the Todo column to prioritize. The higher your feature on the Todo column, the higher the priority. 4. Delegate top priority features Once your features are prioritized and ready to be worked on, give your feature an owner who will oversee the completion of the feature. Making sure each feature has an owner will drive responsibility and ensure that the feature is completed with the quality your customers need. Take it a step further by adding a duration to ensure the feature is built within a timeline. After all, no body wants the feature to get dragged on forever.

    "title": "How product managers use Zepel to plan and ship features",
    "content": "How product managers use Zepel Product managers take the big picture, distill it into features, break and prioritize them using user stories. Since product managers work with every team, being able to quickly see what each team is working on and know what’s happening with the feature is key to plan and prioritize for the road ahead. In this article, we’ll see how a product manager uses Zepel to effortlessly keep track of all the features, prioritize, and work with multiple teams. 1. Create a Project for your team As a product manager, you’d want to bring all the features your team will be working on under one single project. A project in Zepel is usually a team, like Engineering. But if you choose to name your project after a product or an initiative, such as Web App or Android or iOS, that works too! Since you’ll require items to go through statuses to keep everyone updated of progress, you can choose to add one or more Boards while creating your project. Not to worry, you can add them from within the project too. Learn how to create a project -&gt; 2. Create a Feature and add items A Feature houses all actionable items - user stories, tasks, subtasks, bugs, and enhancements - for a specific feature. Adding items for your feature is as simple as writing on a document. Simply hit enter to create another item. And press Cmd + Shift + S if you’re on a Mac (Ctrl + Shift + S on Windows) to toggle between item types. Use Descriptions to add more details to each work item. For example, product managers use description as a place to add acceptance criteria for user stories and attach files below it to share files for further references. 3. Collaborate with the team to get an estimate for your feature Once you’ve added user stories and enhancements for your feature, bring in the rest of the team to estimate and understand the complexity involved in building the feature. Have contextual conversations on each work item and get your development team to break down each user story into subtasks. Breaking down user stories into subtasks helps your team clarity and understanding of what they’ll have to build and hence will be able to add estimations with better accuracy. 4. Prioritize key user stories with Hashtags Now that you have a rough estimate of how long each user story will take to get built, its time to prioritize them. Use the advanced filters to slice and dice all items. Sort your items by Estimate and start adding hashtags # to denote priorities. That way, you get to know what key areas of your feature needs more attention and delegate it to team members appropriately. 5. Track progress of the feature and plan for the road ahead Give each Feature: An owner who will oversee the specific feature A duration to ensure the feature is built within a said timeline, and A status to keep everyone updated on progress As your team makes progress, you’ll see a quick overview of how much work is done. And of course, you can always get a deeper understanding of the progress with reports. As you add more features to your project, use the Table view or the Kanban view to prioritize and plan your future features.

In this article, we’ll see you how you can manage your projects in Zepel, so you never drop the ball with the features you build. 1. Create a Project Creating a project is the first thing you’d be doing once you sign up for Zepel. Its where people with a common goal come together to help ship your feature. A project in Zepel is usually a team, like Engineering. But if you choose to name your project after a product or an initative, such as iOS App or Android App, that works too! While creating a project, you will be able to add one or more Boards into your project that you can use to move your work across Boards or statuses. Learn how to create a project -&gt; 2. Create Features Once you’ve created a project, you can create multiple Features within your project. A Feature is a collection of actionable items - user stories, tasks, subtasks, bugs, and enhancements - that can be tracked and executed. Each Feature can have: An owner who can oversee the feature A duration to ensure the feature is built within a said timeline, and A status to keep everyone updated on progress Learn more about organizing Features -&gt; 3. Create Items Once you’ve created a Feature your team is working on, its time to start adding items. You can create: User Stories Tasks Subtasks Enhancements Bugs Sections Learn how you can quickly create a list of items -&gt; But of course, creating a list of items alone isn’t enough. You’ll want to delegate it, set a deadline, and track its progress. All items in Zepel, except Sections, can have item properties: Assignees Status Due Date Estimate You can add item properties by typing / to trigger all commands. Alternatively, you can open up an item’s details pop-up to set or change any of the properties. NOTE: Sometimes, you’ll find you need to work on items that don’t belong to a specific feature. Product wide tech debts or bugs. You can quickly add them into your project’s List. Learn how you can delegate and track work items -&gt; 4. Add Boards When you’re working on a feature, you’ll need people from other teams - design, QA, and marketing - to contribute as well. But how do you accomodate each of their workflows into your project? Sure, you can add a generic status called “Design In Progress”. But does it mean the mockups are ready for your front end developer to pick it up? Or does it mean the design team is still iterating on getting it pixel perfect? With Boards in Zepel, you can add multiple Boards in your project to accomodate each of your team’s workflow, so everyone can collaborate and work together. All trackable items across Features can move from one status to another like a traditional kanban board and move from one Board to another. That means, when your designer is ready with the mockups for your frontend developer to pick it up, the item can move from Design - Done to Dev - Todo. Learn how to set statuses and manage workflows -&gt; 5. Use My Tasks to work and update every one Sometimes you want to work distraction free. Without having to look at all the other items required to build your new feature. Use My Tasks in Zepel to see just the items assigned to you across all Features in all projects. With the Sort, you can choose to view items assigned to you just the way you’d like. Group and sort them by due dates, sort by estimates, based on which Feature they’re in, and order them by ascending or descending. To make it even more easier, you can work on your items from the comfort of your desktop using Zepel’s Desktop Widget. That way, you can complete and update your team with Zepel right next to your code editor, and not even open your browser. Learn more about Desktop Widget -&gt; 6. Track features using Progress As your team starts working on the feature, you don’t just want to know who is working on which item and its status, you want to know progress of the feature itself. Progress is the command center for your project. You can see progress of your entire feature, know who is responsible for overseeing the completion of the it, its current status, and its duration. With the capability to view all your Features in Kanban to make it easier for you prioritize your feature and Table view to quickly see a timeline of what’s next, product managers and team leaders can quickly get a bird’s eye view of what’s happening in real-time. Learn more about Progress -&gt; 7. Reports to help drive your project forward As your project progresses, you’ll want to keep an eye on the reports to quickly guage if your on track. Head over to the Dashboard tab on your project to see a quick overview of how your project has progressed in the last 14 days.
