IN THIS PAGE Accounts Projects Lists User Stories, Tasks, Subtasks, Enhancements, and Bugs Boards Below is an image of how a project with multiple lists, items, and boards fit inside your account to help you seemlessly organize and track your projects. [IMG] Let us jump in to see what they are and how they work. Accounts An account is an overarching entity that owns all your projects and houses them together under one subdomain - https://comapanyname.zepel.io. An account is usually the name of your company where people are added either as a Member or an Admin. Projects A project is where members of in your organization come together to achieve a common goal. Projects can be features your company is working on, or represent teams such as Design or Data Science. [IMG] People collaborated in a project will be automatically added to the respective account as a Member if they aren’t already part of that account. Read more about Projects -&gt; Lists A list is a collection of actionable work that your team can execute. Each list, depending on how you’ve named your project, can be either a feature or a team. Lists contain actionable next steps that can be assigned and tracked. This is where work gets done. [IMG] Read more about Lists -&gt; User Stories, Tasks, Subtasks, Enhancements, and Bugs Your list can be broken down into smaller chunks of executable work. They can be assigned to more than one person, have due dates, estimates, and statuses. [IMG] The completion of all work items inside each list will determine your entire project’s progress. Read more about creating work items -&gt; Boards Boards in Zepel let you and your team track progress of your work items. A Board ideally represents a workflow each item flows through. Since most projects require members from other teams to get involved, you can have multiple Boards in your project to accomodate each team’s workflow. [IMG] This allows members to track items across lists in a Board that fits their workflow. Read more about Boards -&gt;",

Collaboration, while building features, isn’t just about assigning tasks, sharing files, or having conversations. While they are a part of the collaboration process, most teams resort to face to face communication or meetings if their workflow gets disrupted. In this article, we’ll see you how you can bring in members from every team together and build your next feature. All without disrupting their workflow. 1. Create a Project Give your project a name. Most projects in Zepel are named after a team, like Web App or Mobile. But if you prefer naming your project after the feature, that works well too! [IMG] When creating a project, you’ll be asked to add Boards that teams can use to track and manage their work. 2. Create Lists Once you’ve created a project, its time create Lists. Lists in Zepel is where all actionable work items live. Create multiple Lists inside a project, each representing the feature (if you named your project after a team) you are building. If you named your project after the feature, create a List for every teams involved in building your feature. [IMG] Learn more about organizing Lists -&gt; 3. Add Items To start working on your feature, add items - User Stories, Tasks, Subtasks, Bugs, and Enhancements - to your List. Use Sections to organize your List. Add assignees and due dates to delegate work to team members. That way, everyone knows who is working on what and help you ship your feature faster. [IMG] 4. Add Boards Boards in Zepel are the workflows through which items can move through. Items can move within a Board - from one status to another. Or from one Board to another. Once you’ve created a Items inside your List, its time to add a Board for every team involved in building your feature. With a Board tailor-made for every team, each member can work just the way they want without settling for a generic “In Progress” status. [IMG] Your designer would move their work in Design Board. And once your desiger is ready with design, your front-end developer can pick it up from Design Board and start moving it across his Development Board.

    "content": "How engineering managers use Zepel Engineering managers take features, break it down to actionable chunks of work and manage the engineering team to ensure the feature is built with efficiency. Since engineering managers work with both the product manager and the entire engineering team, their focus often shifts between strategy and managing personnels. In this article, we’ll see how engineering managers use Zepel to manage workload within their team while working with product managers to define the strategic execution of the feature. 1. Create a Project for your team As an engineering manager, you’d want to house all the features your team will be working on under one single project. A project in Zepel is usually a team, like Engineering, Backend, or Frontend. But if you choose to name your project after a product or an initiative, such as Web App or Android or iOS, that works too. [IMG] While creating your project, add Boards your team will use to move items across statuses. If you find your project needs more Boards as your team makes progress on the feature, you can add them from within the project. Learn how to create a project -&gt; 2. Create a List for your feature and prioritize Once a project is created for your team, add a List for each feature your team will be working on. A list houses all actionable items - user stories, tasks, subtasks, bugs, and enhancements - for a specific feature. Normally, the product manager would create Lists and add all the required user stories. Once the product manager has added all the required user stories and descriptions to each feature, you can sit together to give a high level estimate of how long each feature could take and help the product manager prioritize features using the Kanban view. [IMG] 3. Bring in team members to estimate user stories Collaborate with team members and start breaking down user stories into actionable subtasks based on the acceptance criteria added in the description area. Breaking down user stories into subtasks will give your team clarity and help them estimate better. With the help your team members, give each user story an estimate after discussing with your team on the how they’ll execute them. Based on the estimates provided by you and your team, the product manager can now add priority to key user stories from the advanced filter page, and help you and your team focus on the things that are important. [IMG] 4. Delegate prioritized work to team members Once key user stories are prioritized the product manager will give the list an owner, duration, and a status. The owner for the list is usually the person who will oversee the specific feature and ensure its completion within the duration. Depending on how your organization is structured, that could be the engineering manager as well. When its time to begin working on the feature, you can start assigning the prioritized set of user stories and enhancements to your team members. Answer questions to team members on specific items using comments and give them all the information they need to build the feature. [IMG] 5. Track progress of the feature and manage workload As your team work on the features and make progress, get a quick progress update of how your feature has progressed from Lists Overview. [IMG] Use the advanced filters from within your team’s Board to drill in and see how much work each member is working on. That way, you know exactly how much work each member is working on along with their statuses. Now, you can see each team member’s bandwidth in one view and know who has capacity to work on more items and who is overloaded. This will help you quickly manage your team’s workload and route work efficiently. [IMG]",

They can rely on real-time updates of how the features are progressing with Lists Overview. With Boards and Filters, they can now quickly see the team’s capactiy and manage their workload. In this article, we’ll see how you can quickly get an understanding of where each of your team members’ work stand and how you can use this to route work efficiently. 1. Give each team a workflow tailor-made just for them Once you’ve created a List for each feature within your project and added items within them, you should add Boards for each team involved in helping you ship your feature. Building features requires teams to come together and collaborate. At first, its usually just the product manager, engineering manager, developers, and the designer. And as your feature nears completion, you’ll want to bring in your QA team to ensure the feature is bug free and even your marketing team to help get the word out. So, how do you fit all their workflow into a single project project management tool? Create separate projects? Surely, not! Because then you wouldn’t be able to distill all the work they’ve completed into meaningful information. In Zepel, give each team a Board within your project. That way, every time your team mates work on the feature they can work just the way they want and be more productive. [IMG] Learn how to add Boards -&gt; 2. Switch to your team’s board and drill in Head over to your team’s Board to see where each item stands.

    "content": "Plan and prioritize the right features Product managers use Zepel to plan their next set of features and to prioritize them. Prioritizing features is hard mostly because the needs of your business is ever changing. What was a top priority few weeks ago could easily be something you can’t afford to spend time on right now. Which is why it’s key to be able to see what’s happening within your team and use that context when planning and prioritizing your next bunch of features. In this article, we’ll show how you can see what your team’s working on, their progress, and how you can use that context to plan your next set of features and prioritize them. 1. Put User Stories together and plan your feature Don’t worry about prioritizing the feature at first. Create a List for your new feature and put together all user stories and tasks you’d ideally want to accomplish. Add acceptance criteria for your user stories within the Description to help everyone understand what’s expected of them. [IMG] 2. Understand your team’s current progress Your team is most likely working on a couple of other features, completed few user stories, and made some progress. Since each List within your project represents a feature, this makes it effortless for you as the product manager to see what’s happening in the feature and who is working on which user story or enhancement. [IMG] But knowing where each user story stands isn’t going to be enough if you want to get a bird’s eye view of what’s happening. You need to quickly distil all the progress your developer team, designer, and QA team made into useful information to make sense out of them. With Progress, you can get a quick snapshot of how much progress your team has made and how far away they are from completing the feature. [IMG] 3. See features in Kanban to Prioritize The entire thought process of prioritizing features is a whole different beast altogether. We’ve put together a process and wrote in detail about how you should think about prioritizing your feature over here. With the right thought process and the context of your team’s current feature progress, you can now view and rearrange your features in a Kanban and start prioritizing them. From the Progress tab, switch to Kanban view to see all your features neatly stacked based on their current status. [IMG] Rearrange features within the Todo column to prioritize. The higher your feature on the Todo column, the higher the priority. 4. Delegate top priority features to managers Once your features are prioritized and ready to be worked on, give your feature an owner who will oversee the completion of the feature. Making sure each feature has an owner will drive responsibility and ensure they see to it that the feature is completed with the quality your customers need. Take it a step further by adding a duration to ensure the feature is built within a timeline. After all, no body wants the feature to get dragged on forever.",

    "content": "How product managers use Zepel Product managers take the big picture, distill it into features, break and prioritize them using user stories. Since product managers work with every team, being able to quickly see what each team is working on and know what’s happening with the feature is key to plan and prioritize for the road ahead. In this article, we’ll see how a product manager uses Zepel to effortlessly keep track of all the features, prioritize, and work with multiple teams. 1. Create a Project for your team As a product manager, you’d want to bring all the features your team will be working on under one single project. A project in Zepel is usually a team, like Engineering. But if you choose to name your project after a product or an initiative, such as Web App or Android or iOS, that works too! [IMG] Since you’ll require items to go through statuses to keep everyone updated of progress, you can choose to add one or more Boards while creating your project. Not to worry, you can add them from within the project too. Learn how to create a project -&gt; 2. Create a List for your feature and add items Lists represent the features your working on. A list houses all actionable items - user stories, tasks, subtasks, bugs, and enhancements - for a specific feature. Adding items for your feature is as simple as writing on a document. Simply hit enter to create another item. And press Cmd + Shift + S if you’re on a Mac (Ctrl + Shift + S on Windows) to toggle between item types. Use Descriptions to add more details to each work item. For example, product managers use description as a place to add acceptance criteria for user stories and attach files below it to share files for further references. 3. Collaborate with the team to get an estimate for your feature Once you’ve added user stories and enhancements for your feature, bring in Engineering Mangager and the rest of the team to understand the complexity involved in building the feature. Have contextual conversations on each work item and get your development team to break down each user story into subtasks. Breaking down user stories into subtasks helps your team clarity and understanding of what they’ll have to build and hence will be able to add estimations with better accuracy. 4. Prioritize key user stories with Hashtags Now that you have a rough estimate of how long each user story will take to get built, its time to prioritize them. Use the advanced filters to slice and dice all items. Sort your items by Estimate and start adding hashtags # to denote priorities. That way, your Engineering Manager knows what are the key areas of your feature that needs more attention and can delegate it to team members appropriately. 5. Track progress of the feature and plan for the road ahead Give each list: An owner who will oversee the specific feature A duration to ensure the feature is built within a said timeline, and A status to keep everyone updated on progress [IMG] As your team makes progress, you’ll see a quick overview of how much work is done. And of course, you can always get a deeper understanding of the progress with reports. As you add more features to your project, use the Table view or the Kanban view to prioritize and plan your future features. Learn more about organizing Lists -&gt;",

Alternatively, you can open up an item’s details pop-up to set or change any of the properties. Learn how you can delegate and track work items -&gt; 4. Add Boards When you’re working on a feature, you’ll need people from other teams - design, QA, and marketing - to contribute as well. But how do you accomodate each of their workflows into your project? Sure, you can add a generic status called “Design In Progress”. But does it mean the mockups are ready for your front end developer to pick it up? Or does it mean the design team is still iterating on getting it pixel perfect? With Boards in Zepel, you can add multiple Boards in your project to accomodate each of your team’s workflow, so everyone can collaborate and work together. [IMG] All trackable items across lists can move from one status to another like a traditional kanban board and move from one Board to another. That means, when your designer is ready with the mockups for your frontend developer to pick it up, the item can move from Design - Done to Dev - Todo. Learn how to set statuses and manage workflows -&gt; 5. Use My Tasks to work and update every one Sometimes you want to work distraction free. Without having to look at all the other items required to build your new feature. Use My Tasks in Zepel to see just the items assigned to you across all lists in all projects. [IMG] With the Sort, you can choose to view items assigned to you just the way you’d like.
