### Create a Project

A project is where group of members come together to achieve a common goal. Projects in Zepel can represent teams such as Engineering and Data Science.

But if you prefer to have projects named after features your company is working on, Zepel will work just fine.

### Add Lists inside a Project

Projects in Zepel can have multiple Lists. That way, if you have your project named after specific teams, each list of tasks can represent the feature your team is working on.

And if your project is named after a feature, each list can represent specific teams involved in your feature, so you can see what's happening in every team in your project.

### Create Items

Items and its types - Stories, Enhancements, Bugs, Tasks, and Subtasks are at the core of Zepel. You can delegate, set deadlines, and track statuses of your work. 

Once you've created a List inside your project, start adding related work items into your list, so you can keep your team aligned on same page.

- When your List is empty, you can choose to create a Section or a Task. 
- To change an item's type, right click on the item and select which type you would like to change to.
- Hit <b>[ Tab ]</b> to turn any item into a Subtask.
