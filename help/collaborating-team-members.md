### Accounts

An account is an overarching entity that owns all your projects and houses them together. An account is usually the name of your company where people are added either as a Member or an Admin.

---

### Projects 

A project is where members of in your organization come together to achieve a common goal. Projects can be features your company is working on, or represent teams such as Design or Data Science.

People collaborated in a project will be automatically added to the respective account as a Member if they aren't already part of that account.

### Lists

A list is a collection of actionable work that your team can execute. Each list, depending on how you've named your project, can be either a feature or a team. Lists contain actionable next steps that can be assigned and tracked. This is where work gets done.

People collaborated in a list will be automatically added to the respective project and they will have access to all lists created within that project. They will also automatically be added to the account as a Member if they aren't already part of the account.

### User Stories, Tasks, Subtasks, Enhancements, and Bugs

Your list can be broken down into smaller chunks of executable work. They can be assigned to more than one person, have due dates, estimates, and statuses.

The completion of all work items inside each list will determine your entire project's progress.
