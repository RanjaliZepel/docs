# How engineering managers use Zepel
{: .no_toc }

Engineering managers take the big picture vision of features, break it down to actionable chunks of work, and manage the engineering team to ensure the feature is built with efficiency.

Since engineering managers work with both the product manager and the entire engineering team, their focus often shifts between strategy and managing personnels.

In this article, we'll see how an engineering manager uses Zepel to manage workload within the team and work with the product manager to define the strategic execution of the feature.

## 1. Create a Project for your team

As an engineering manager, you'd want to house all the features your team will be working on under one single project. 

A project in Zepel is usually a team, like Engineering, Backend, or Frontend. But if you choose to name your project after a product or an initiative, such as Web App or Android or iOS, that works too.

While creating your project, add Boards your team will use to move items across statuses. If you find your project needs more Boards as your team works on features,, you can still add them from within the project.

## 2. Create a List for your feature and add items

Once a project is created for your team, add a List for each feature your team will be working on. A list houses all actionable items - user stories, tasks, subtasks, bugs, and enhancements - for a specific feature. 

Normally, the product manager would create Lists and add all the required user stories. 

Adding items for your feature is as simple as writing on a document. Simply hit enter to create another item. And press ```Cmd + Shift + S``` if you're on a Mac (Ctrl + Shift + S on Windows) to toggle between item types.

Use Descriptions to add more details to each work item. For example, product managers use description as a place to add acceptance criteria for user stories and attach files below it to share files for further references.

## 3. Collaborate with the team to get an estimate for your feature

Once you've added user stories and enhancements for your feature, bring in Engineering Mangager and the rest of the team to understand the complexity involved in building the feature.

Have contextual conversations on each work item and get your development team to break down each user story into subtasks.

Breaking down user stories into subtasks helps your team clarity and understanding of what they'll have to build and hence will be able to add estimations with better accuracy.

## 4. Prioritize key user stories with Hashtags

Now that you have a rough estimate of how long each user story will take to get built, its time to prioritize them.

Use the advanced filters to slice and dice all items. Sort your items by Estimate and start adding hashtags ```#``` to denote priorities.

That way, your Engineering Manager knows what are the key areas of your feature that needs more attention and can delegate it to team members appropriately.

## 5. Track progress of the feature and plan for the road ahead

Give each list: 
1. An owner who will oversee the specific feature 
2. A duration to ensure the feature is built within a said timeline, and
3. A status to keep everyone updated on progress

As your team makes progress, you'll see a quick overview of how much work is done. And of course, you can always get a deeper understanding of the progress with reports.

As you add more features to your project, use the Table view or the Kanban view to prioritize and plan your future features.
