# Importing Jira Projects into Zepel
{: .no_toc }

The one click importer will help you move your projects out of Jira to test in Zepel, so you can get started right away. After your project is imported, youâ€™ll see all your Jira issues as trackable items with assignees, due dates, statuses, and even comments right where they belong.

Switching to Zepel over Jira lets you work on your projects without bringing you or your team down with complexity or clutter.

## How to import your Jira project into Zepel

* Access the account settings popup from the menu bar on the top left corner. 
* Navigate to the Import tab in the account settings popup. Click on the import button.
* Enter your Jira credentials to view your projects. Please note that you need to be a Jira admin to access all your projects through the API. 
* Select the projects that you want to import into Zepel. You may choose upto 10 projects at a time. 
* Once you have selected and confirmed the projects you want to import, click the "**Import**" to start the import.

The import can take anywhere between a few seconds to a couple of hours based on the size of your Jira projects and the number of issues being imported. 

You will get an email notification once the import is successful. 

Any new team members on Jira (who are not in Zepel) will get added as new members and will be notified via email too.
