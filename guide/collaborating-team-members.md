## Collaborate in a Squad

You can choose to collaborate members in a squad, so you can assign pieces of work to them and work together.

### <u>To collaborate members into a squad:</u>
{: .no_toc }

By default, all squads in Zepel are private, till you specifically add a member into a squad.

If a member you are trying to collaborate is not part of the account already, they will automatically get added into your account.
