After clicking on Add Board, boards you selected (along with their status columns) will be added to your current squad and can be used to set statuses for all items in your squad.

Of course, if you're not satisfied with it, you can always make changes and [edit the Board]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/editing-boards.md %}).
