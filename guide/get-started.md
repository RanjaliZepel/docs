# Getting Started With Zepel
{: .no_toc }

New to Zepel? Welcome! ðŸ¤—
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

Zepel is the project management tool that makes it effortless for you to go from customer requests to shipped software painlessly.

Once you've signed up, you are only 3 steps away from tracking progress of software development.

Let's jump in and see how you can get started quickly.

## Step 1: Create a Squad

In Zepel, you don't create a project. You create a Squad.

A squad is where a cross functional team comes together to achieve a common goal.

For example, you could name your squad as *Web App*, *Android App*, or *iOS app*.

To create a squad, click on the `Create Squad` button.

## Step 2: Create Features your Squad will be working on

Your squad builds features and fixes bugs. So, Zepel calls them as they are instead of creating an epic confusion.

Once you've created a squad, you can create multiple features and track their progress using the [Progress]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/progress.md %}).

## Step 3: Create Actionable Items for your Feature

But of course, your feature has several moving parts.

Small tasks that need to be completed. Enhancements that need to be added. And several interactions that you'd define as user stories.

That's why once you've created a feature, you can create multiple items of type task, subtask, user stories, enhancements, and bugs. And to make it easier to organize, you can create Sections and group similar items together.

![Items and its types in Zepel](/guide/assets/uploads/zepel-items.png "Items in Zepel")

This way, your squad isn't just checking off an isolated issue. They get to see everything that's needed to build the feature and achieve an outcome.

**"But our team also fixes bugs!", you say. And we hear you.**

That's why every squad has a list. 

This is where miscellaneous bugs get added. Or tech debts.

Once you've created items, they can be assigned, estimated, have due dates, comments, descriptions, [and more]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/working-with-teams.md %})!

And then, you can choose to track their progress either on a [Kanban Board]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/boards.md %}) or using [Sprints]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/sprints.md %}).
