# Difference between List Board and Project Board
{: .no_toc }

## Project Boards

Project Boards are visible on the sidebar within your project. You can have multiple Boards in your project. Each Board can be used by multiple Lists. 

For example, if you have two Lists named Search and Reports with Dev Board being used in both the Lists, you will view all items from both the Lists on the Dev Board if you open it from the project sidebar.

If your project board is used in multiple Lists within your project, you will be able to view all items across Lists. You can choose to [Filter your Board]({{ site.url }}{% link guide/boards-filter.md %}) based on a specific List to view just those items.

Project Boards can also be Favourited to quickly access them from the sidebar.

Project Boards are useful when you want to see where work stands across Lists. For example, you might want to see what all work is happening in different features in the Dev Board. The project board also comes in handy when you want to [manage your team's workload]({{ site.url }}{% link guide/manage-workload.md %}).

## List Board

Within a List Board, you will view items only from that particular List. Furthermore, there are two types of List Boards:

1. **Default List Board:** All items in the List will use this Board when status is not set.
2. **Other List Board:** When an item is explictly moved to a Board that is not the Default Board.

List Boards can not be favourited.

List Boards are useful when you want to just see what's happening within a specific List. With just a quick glance you can see the different workflows being used to complete the feature. And by clicking on the List Board, you can see where each item stands.
