# Importing Asana Projects into Zepel Squads
{: .no_toc }

The one click importer will help you move your projects away from Asana and into Zepel as squads, so you can start working on your squads from where you left off. After your Asana project is imported as squad into Zepel, youâ€™ll see all your Asana tasks as trackable items with assignees, due dates, statuses, and even comments right where they belong.

Moving your Asana projects onto Zepel squads will give you the flexibility to manage your squads just the way you want without being restricted to just Tasks.

* Access the account settings popup from the menu bar on the top left corner.
