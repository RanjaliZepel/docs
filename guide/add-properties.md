## Assign items

Once you've collaborated your project with your team members, you can delegate pieces of work to them by assigning work items from your List. 

When assigned, your team mates will be notified via Slack (if you've integrated your account with Slack) and email.

#### <u>Using Keyboard</u>
{: .no_toc }
- With the cursor on the item you want to assign to, type ``` /a ```.
- You will now see a list of members collaborated on your project. 
- Select a member from the drop down suggestion to assign the task to them.

#### <u>Using Mouse</u>
{: .no_toc }

- From the drop down suggestion, select a member to assign the task to them.

## Set due dates

Due dates let you set deadlines for your work items. 

When a specific work item is not yet completed on the due date, member assigned to that item will be notified via email. That way, your team never misses another deadline and all your work items stay updated.

#### <u>Using Keyboard</u>
{: .no_toc }
- With the cursor on the item you want to set a due date to, type ```/d```.
- From the calendar drop down, select a date.
- Alternatively, you can just type ```Today```, ```Tomorrow```, ```Yesterday```, ```Next Monday```, or the date.

#### <u>Using Mouse</u>
{: .no_toc }
- From the list, right click on the item you want to set a due date to.
- Select the calendar icon from the item menu.
- From the drop down suggestion, select a date to set it as the item's due date.

## Update statuses

Adding statuses to your work items help the entire team stay updated on your progress. 

By default, all projects will have a Default Workflow with Todo, In Progress, Resolved, and Done statuses. You can add a new Board in your project to match statuses with your workflow.

#### <u>Using Keyboard</u>
{: .no_toc }
- With the cursor on the item you want to update a status for, type ```/s```.
- From the status drop down, select the status.

#### <u>Using Mouse</u>
{: .no_toc }

## Estimate items

Add an estimate to your work item, so you can see an approximate estimate of how long your work will take to get completed.

Estimates in Zepel are measured in points. They are useful when you'd like to view Burnup and Burndown charts for your Sprint. Or when you Filter your List.

#### <u>Using Keyboard</u>
{: .no_toc }
- With the cursor on the item you want to estimate, type ```/e```.
- In the text field, enter a number between 0.01 and 1000.

#### <u>Using Mouse</u>
{: .no_toc }
- From the list, right click on the item you want to estimate.
- Select timer icon from the item menu.
- Enter a number between 0.01 and 1000 in the text field to estimate your item.
