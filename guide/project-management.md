# Manage Projects with Zepel
{: .no_toc }

Every organization and team have their own ways of managing projects and shipping features.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

In this article, we'll see you how you can manage your projects in Zepel, so you never drop the ball with the features you build.

---

## 1. Create a Project

Creating a project is the first thing you'd be doing once you sign up for Zepel. Its where people with a common goal come together to help ship your feature. 

A project in Zepel is usually a team, like Web App or Android or iOS. But if you choose to name your project after a product or an initative, that works too!

While creating a project, you will be able to add one or more Boards into your project that you can use to move your work across Boards or statuses.

## 2. Create Lists

Once you've created a project, you can now create multiple Lists. A list is usually a feature that houses all actionable items - user stories, tasks, subtasks, bugs, and enhancements - within it. 

Each list can have: 
1. An owner who can oversee the feature 
2. A duration to ensure the feature is built within a said timeline, and
3. A status to keep everyone updated on progress

Note: Teams that name a project after a feature, usually create a List for each team involved in shipping the feature.

## 3. Create Items

Once you've created a List for a feature your team is working on, its time to start adding items. 

You can create:
1. User Stories
2. Tasks
3. Subtasks
4. Enhancements
5. Bugs
6. Sections

But of course, creating a list of items alone isn't enough. You'll want to delegate it, set a deadline, and track its progress.

All items in Zepel, except Sections, can have item properties:
1. Assignees
2. Status
3. Due Date
4. Estimate

You can add item properties by typing ```/``` to trigger all commands. Alternatively, you can open up an item's details pop-up to set or change any of the properties.

## 4. Add Boards

When you're working on a feature, you'll need people from other teams - design, QA, and marketing - to contribute as well. But how do you accomodate each of their workflows into your project? 

Sure, you can add a generic status called "Design In Progress". But does it mean the mockups are ready for your front end developer to pick it up? Or does it mean the design team is still iterating on getting it pixel perfect?

With Boards in Zepel, you can add multiple Boards in your project to accomodate each of your team's workflow, so everyone can collaborate and work together.

All trackable items across lists can move from one status to another like a traditional kanban board **and** move from one Board to another. 

That means, when your designer is ready with the mockups for your frontend developer to pick it up, the item can move from ```Design - Done``` to ```Dev - Todo```.

## 5. Use My Tasks to work and update every one

Sometimes you want to work distraction free. Without having to look at all the other items required to build your new feature.

Use My Tasks in Zepel to see just the items assigned to you across all lists in all projects. 

[IMG]

With the Sort, you can choose to view items assigned to you just the way you'd like. Group and sort them by due dates, sort by estimates, based on which List they're in, and order them by ascending or descending.

To make it even more easier, you can work on your items from the comfort of your desktop using Zepel's Desktop Widget. That way, you can complete and update your team with Zepel right next to your code editor, and not even open your browser.

## 6. Track progress of each Feature with Lists Overview

As your team starts working on the feature, you don't just want to know who is working on which item and its status, you want to know progress of the feature itself. 

Lists Overview is the command center for your project. You can see progress of your entire feature, know who is responsible for overseeing the completion of the it, its current status, and its duration.

With the capability to view all your lists in Kanban to make it easier for you prioritize your feature and Table view to quickly see a timeline of what's next, product managers and team leaders can quickly get a bird's eye view of what's happening in real-time.

## 7. Reports to help drive your project forward

As your project progresses, you'll want to keep an eye on the reports to quickly guage if your on track.

Head over to the Dashboard tab on your project to see a quick overview of how your project has progressed in the last 14 days.

If you're running Sprints, you can view Burnup or Burndown chart for your specific sprint from the sprints menu.
