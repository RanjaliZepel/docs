# Bug Tracking
{: .no_toc }

File and track bugs with Zepel, so your feature is always ship worthy.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

Bugs can creep into features unexpectedly and delay your feature launch. Even worse, it might get missed out and your customers might run into them.

In this article, we'll see you how you can file and keep track of bugs using Zepel, so you can squish and push bug free features every time.

## 1. Create a Project

Give your project a name. Most projects in Zepel are named after a team, like Web App or Mobile. But if you prefer naming your project after the feature, that works well too!

When creating a project, you'll be asked to add Boards that teams can use to track and manage their work.

## 2. Create Lists

Once you've created a project, its time create Lists. Lists in Zepel is where all actionable work items live. 

Create multiple Lists inside a project, each representing the feature (if you named your project after a team) you are building. If you named your project after the feature, create a List for every teams involved in building your feature.

## 3. Add Items

To start working on your feature, add items - User Stories, Tasks, Subtasks, Bugs, and Enhancements - to your List. 

Use Sections to organize your List. Add assignees and due dates to delegate work to team members. That way, everyone knows who is working on what and help you ship your feature faster.

## 4. Add Boards

Boards in Zepel are the workflows through which items can move through. 

Items can move within a Board - from one status to another. Or from one Board to another. 

Once you've created a Items inside your List, its time to add a Board for every team involved in building your feature. 

With a Board tailor-made for every team, each member can work just the way they want without settling for a generic "In Progress" status.

Your designer would move their work in Design Board. And once your desiger is ready with design, your front-end developer can pick it up from Design Board and start moving it across his Development Board.

## 5. Watch the entire feature progress from within the List

While members from every team pick up items assigned to them move them across statuses and Boards, you can see how your feature take its shape and progress across teams.

If you want to see what each team is working on, you can simply click on their respective Board and get quick glance of what's happening.
