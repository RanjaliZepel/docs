# Plan and prioritize the right features
{: .no_toc }

Product managers use Zepel to plan their next set of features and to prioritize them.

Prioritizing features is hard mostly because the needs of your business is ever changing. What was a top priority few weeks ago could easily be something you can't afford to spend time on right now. 

Which is why it's key to be able to see what's happening within your team and use that context when planning and prioritizing your next bunch of features.

In this article, we'll show how you can see what your team's working on, their progress, and how you can use that context to plan your next set of features and prioritize them.

## 1. Put User Stories together and plan your feature

Don't worry about prioritizing the feature at first. 

Create a List for your new feature and put together all user stories and tasks you'd ideally want to accomplish.

Add acceptance criteria for your user stories within the Description to help everyone understand what's expected of them.

## 2. Understand your team's current progress

Your team is most likely working on a couple of other features, completed few user stories, and made some progress.

Since each List within your project represents a feature, this makes it effortless for you as the product manager to see what's happening in the feature and who is working on which user story or enhancement.

But knowing where each user story stands isn't going to be enough if you want to get a bird's eye view of what's happening. 

You need to quickly distil all the progress your developer team, designer, and QA team made into useful information to make sense out of them.

With Progress, you can get a quick snapshot of how much progress your team has made and how far away they are from completing the feature.

## 3. See features in Kanban to Prioritize

The entire thought process of prioritizing features is a whole different beast altogether. We've put together a process and wrote in detail about how you should think about prioritizing your feature [over here](https://blog.zepel.io/prioritize-product-feature-backlog/).

With the right thought process and the context of your team's current feature progress, you can now view and rearrange your features in a Kanban and start prioritizing them.

From the Progress tab, switch to Kanban view to see all your features neatly stacked based on their current status.

Rearrange features within the Todo column to prioritize. The higher your feature on the Todo column, the higher the priority.

## 4. Delegate top priority features to managers

Once your features are prioritized and ready to be worked on, give your feature an owner who will oversee the completion of the feature. 

Making sure each feature has an owner will drive responsibility and ensure they see to it that the feature is completed with the quality your customers need.

Take it a step further by adding a duration to ensure the feature is built within a timeline. After all, no body wants the feature to get dragged on forever.
