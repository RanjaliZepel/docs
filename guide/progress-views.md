# Views in Progress
{: .no_toc }

Progress of features can be tracked from 3 different views:
- Kanban
- Table
- Grid

---

**Kanban View:** The Kanban view shows you a quick status of the feature's progress. Similar to any Kanban, you can move a Feature card across statuses to update feature progress. Or move a Feature card within the status to prioritize specific features.

**Table View:** The Table view is helpful when you want to sort them based on the Duration, the Progress, Created date, or by Name. This view is useful when you want to get a quick progress of all your features.

**Grid View:** The Grid view is helpful when you just want to see all the features being worked on in the project.
