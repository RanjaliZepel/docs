## 1. Add items to Lists

Got assigned on a user story? 

Break it down further by creating subtasks, categorize with hashtags, and drill down to the details of estimates, statuses, and assignees. All without taking hands off your favourite device - keyboard.

Use Descriptions to share code snippets with team mates and collaborate using Comments and Attachments.

Simply type ``` / ``` to add any of the item properties so you can always keep your team updated on your progress.

## 2. Work distraction free with My Tasks

Sometimes you just want to work with none of the distractions. Without all the other user stories and bugs.

Head over to My Tasks to view just the items assigned to you and work distraction free. Mould it fit your needs by sorting and grouping items based on due dates, estimates, or simply by alphabetical.
