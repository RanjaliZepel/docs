# How Developers complete work and beat deadlines
{: .no_toc }

Zepel lets you "*go from requests to shipped software*" painlessly.

While a [product manager]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/product-manager.md %}) might turn requests into priorities in Zepel, developers turn those priorities into usable software.

In this article, we'll see how you, a developer, can stay on top of your work and build software together painlessly.

## 1. Link Feature to a Branch

Once the product manager delegates the prioritized request to a squad and specs it in detail using items, you can [link the feature to a branch]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/link-feature-to-branch.md %}). This will automatically update the feature's status from `Todo` to `In Progress`. 

However, a feature requires you to build multiple functionalities and complete several tasks.

This is where the items inside your feature come into play!

A product manager would've spec'd the feature using different types of items - user stories, tasks, enhancements, sub-tasks, and bugs.

This detailed spec of actionable items allows you to view exactly what needs to be completed to build the said features.

## 2. Track using Sprints or Kanban

Of course, you'd want to track the progress of each of the item to completion.

Break it down further by creating subtasks, categorize with hashtags, and drill down to the details of [estimates]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/set-estimates.md %}) and [assignees]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/assign.md %}). 

[Use Descriptions]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/description.md %}) to share code snippets with team mates and collaborate using [comments]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/comments.md %}), [attachments]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/attachments.md %}), [external links]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/add-external-links.md %}), and more.

And depending on your team's preference you can choose to either [run Sprints]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/how-to-run-sprints-in-zepel.md %}) or track them on a [Kanban Board]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/boards.md %}).

If you choose to run Sprints, Zepel has you covered with reports like Burn up and Burn down charts. And if you prefer to track using a Kanban Board, you've got the cumulative flow chart.

## 3. Work distraction free with My Tasks

Sometimes you just want to work with none of the distractions.

Head over to My Tasks to view just the items assigned to you and work distraction free. Mould it fit your needs by sorting and grouping items based on due dates, estimates, or simply by alphabetical.

## 4. Change statuses automatically with Git Automatiion

If you haven't already, integrate your account with [GitHub]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/github-integration.md %}), [Bitbucket]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/bitbucket-integration.md %}), or [GitLab]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/gitlab-integration.md %}).

Once you've integrated, make sure to set up [Git Workflow automation]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/setup-git-automation.md %}). With the automation configured, you can link any item assigned to a commit or pull request and Zepel will automatically update statuses for you. This way, all items have the latest status updates.

## 5. Update teammates automatically with Slack

Automatically updating statuses based on your workflow in Git is great. But if you can automatically change statuses and also update your teammates, that's even better.

In Zepel, you can [link your squad to your preferred Slack channel]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/link-with-slack.md %}) and customize the notifications you want receive.

This way, your development workflow is completely automated and you can spend time focussing on building software.
