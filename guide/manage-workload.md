## 2. Switch to your team's board and drill in

Head over to your team's Board to see where each item stands. With just a click, the Board provides you a single view of all items that requires your team's attention.

With filters within your Board, you can easily drill in to see who is working on which feature and their current status. This helps you take informed decisions if you need to add more people to work a specific feature and keep your priorities on track.
